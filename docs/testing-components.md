# Testing components

## Accessibility testing

If you create a component in the application, you can run accessibility tests against it.

The gem [includes integration tests](lib/govuk_publishing_components/minitest/component_guide_test.rb) to check that your component guide and examples are error free and that they meet basic accessibility needs.

Automated accessibility tests use [aXe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core). Using our `AccessibilityTest` wrapper the gem runs the aXe suite against each example and throws JavaScript errors for any violations. These JavaScript errors can be used to fail a build in CI.

You can set this up by adding the following integration test.

```ruby
# test/integration/component_guide_test.rb
require 'govuk_publishing_components/minitest/component_guide_test'

class ComponentGuideTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest
  include GovukPublishingComponents::Minitest::ComponentGuideTest
end
```

(There's no RSpec variant for this yet, PRs welcome)

### Exclude accessibility rules

Sometimes you will have a component that will throw an error due to it being in isolation, for example radio buttons not being in a fieldset.

For this case you can add `accessibility_excluded_rules` to your components' documentation yml file with the rules you want to exclude. These rules can be found in brackets in the error messages displayed.

For an example of this check [test-component-with-duplicate-ids.yml](../spec/dummy/app/views/components/docs/test-component-with-duplicate-ids.yml)


## Visual regression testing

Visual regression tests are run on each pull request using a third-party tool called [Percy](https://percy.io) using a [GitHub Action workflow][1]. This isn't a mandatory check, so any changes that are highlighted by Percy won't prevent a pull request from being merged in.

The screenshots are public, so they can be checked without logging in. A BrowserStack account is needed to approve or reject any changes. It's the responsibility of the person reviewing the pull request code to approve any visual changes that Percy highlights.

Relevant Percy setup documentation:

 * [Running Percy in a GitHub Action](https://docs.percy.io/docs/github-actions)
