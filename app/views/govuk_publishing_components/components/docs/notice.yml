name: Notice
description: A notice to convey and highlight information
body: |
  The notice component replaces the notice and withdrawal notice patterns on GOV.UK.

  The component accepts either a simple string `description_text` parameter that it wraps in a paragraph, or a `description_govspeak` parameter that is rendered through govspeak for more complex HTML layout.
uses_component_wrapper_helper: true
accessibility_criteria: |
  The notice must:

  - have a border colour contrast ratio of more than 4.5:1 with its background to be visually distinct.
  - always render headings with associated description content, so there are no isolated heading elements inside the component

    description: In some circumstances it may be necessary to include simple markup in the title, such as a link. Note that this will be wrapped in a H2 tag if there is no description included, so be sure that any markup inserted is valid inside that tag (e.g. another heading tag inside a H2 would be invalid).

    description: |
      Passing a lang value allows the content of the notice to be labelled as being a different language from surrounding content.
      The lang attribute must be set to a [valid BCP47 string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang#Language_tag_syntax). A valid code can be the two or three letter language code - for example, English is `en` or `eng`, Korean is `ko` or `kor` - but if in doubt please check.
