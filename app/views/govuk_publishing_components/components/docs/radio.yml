name: Form radio button
description: A radio button is an element that allows users to answer a question by selecting an option. If you have a question with more than one option you should stack radio buttons.
body: |
  You can also use 'or' as an item to break up radios.

  If JavaScript is disabled a conditionally revealed content expands fully. All of the functionality (including aria attributes) are added using JavaScript.

accessibility_criteria: |
  Radio buttons should

  - accept focus
  - be focusable with a keyboard
  - be usable with a keyboard
  - indicate when they have focus
  - change in appearance when active (in the active state)
  - be usable with touch
  - have label with a touch area similar to the input
  - be usable with [voice commands](https://www.w3.org/WAI/perspectives/voice.html)
  - have visible text
  - have a meaningful accessible name
  - be usable when interacting with the label
  - additional information in hint text should be read out found when focusing inputs
  - should always be used nested in a fieldset so that it has proper context, useful for users of assistive technologies.

  [Keyboard interaction](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#radiobutton)

  - when a radio group receives focus:
    - if a radio button is checked, focus is set on the checked button.
    - if none of the radio buttons are checked, focus is set on the first radio button in the group.
  - Space: checks the focused radio button if it is not already checked.
  - Right Arrow and Down Arrow: move focus to the next radio button in the group, uncheck the previously focused button, and check the newly focused button. If focus is on the last button, focus moves to the first button.
  - Left Arrow and Up Arrow: move focus to the previous radio button in the group, uncheck the previously focused button, and check the newly focused button. If focus is on the first button, focus moves to the last button.

accessibility_excluded_rules:
  - aria-expanded # We use aria expanded to reflect the state of a conditionally revealed radio content even if this attribute is not officially supported on this element.
