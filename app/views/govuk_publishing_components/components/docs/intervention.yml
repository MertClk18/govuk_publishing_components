name: Intervention
description: An area that contains personalised content to the user
body: |
  The intervention is used to show personalised content. For instance, if the user has visited multiple
  pages in the same area of the site, we might want let them know that there are other pages on GOV.UK
  that would be useful to them. This component would be used to add this personalised content and would
  indicate to the user that this is not normally part of the page, but has been added for them specifically.

  The dismiss link works without Javascript by pointing to the current URL with the "hide-intervention"
  query string parameter set to "true". It's progressively enhanced and sets a cookie to remember that
  the user has dismissed the banner before. The cookie requires a "name" parameter, the value of which
  is stored in the cookie to distinguish which campaign banner the user has dismissed.

examples:
  default:
    data:
      suggestion_text: You should renew your permit every 6 months.

  with_suggestion_link:
    data:
      suggestion_text: Based on your browsing you might be interested in
      suggestion_link_text: "Travel abroad: step by step"
      suggestion_link_url: /travel-abroad

  with_dismiss_link:
    description: |
      Name is required in order to set a cookie. The name value should be distinct to the campaign for the banner,
      so that other banners using this component are not hidden by accident.
    data:
      suggestion_text: You should renew your permit every 6 months.
      dismiss_text: Hide this suggestion
      name: campaign-name

  with_hide:
    description: |
      This example is for when we want to hide by default and display to the user based on some logic,
      either in the backend or with Javascript.
    data:
      suggestion_text: You should renew your permit every 6 months.
      suggestion_link_text: You may be invited to fill in a questionnaire
      suggestion_link_url: /questionnaire

  open_suggestion_link_in_new_tab:
    description: |
      When sending users to another online task, you don't want to completely hijack
      their original flow on GOV.UK. Adding the option to open links in a new tab helps to address this.
      Link text should tell the user that the link opens in a new tab.
      Note: "(opens in a new tab)" is added to link text if the phrase isn't included.
    data:
      suggestion_text: You should renew your permit every 6 months.
      suggestion_link_text: You can now apply for a permit online
      suggestion_link_url: www.google.com/permit
      new_tab: true

  with_data_attributes:
    description: |
      This example shows the use of `suggestion_data_attributes`,
      `dismiss_data_attributes` for click tracking on the dismiss section <p> tag, and `dismiss_link_data_attributes` for adding attributes to the dismiss link <a> tag.

      Other data attributes can also be applied as required. Note that the component does not include built in tracking. If this is required consider using the [track click script](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/blob/main/docs/analytics/track-click.md).
    data:
      suggestion_text: Based on your browsing you might be interested in
      suggestion_link_text: "Travel abroad: step by step"
      suggestion_link_url: /travel-abroad
      suggestion_data_attributes:
        track-category: interventionBanner
        track-action: interventionClicked

  without_ga4_tracking:
    description: |
      Disables GA4 tracking on the banner. Tracking is enabled by default. This includes link tracking on the component itself, event tracking on the 'Hide' link, and allows pageviews to record the presence of the banner on page load.
    data:
      disable_ga4: true
      suggestion_text: Based on your browsing you might be interested in
