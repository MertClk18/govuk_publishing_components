  with_customised_links:
    description: |
      For all links shown in the component, visually hidden text containing the name of the thing it refers to is automatically appended. This offers a better experience for screen reader users by making the link text unique and more explicit. In the example below, the link text would be `Change Title, summary and body`.

      The text of the link can be customised using the `link_text` option. Take care that the provided `link_text` still makes sense to screen readers when combined with the title. For instance, `Reorder` link text and `Items` title becomes `Reorder Items`, which reads fine, but link text of `Summary` would read as `Summary Items`, which does not make sense.

      To override this behaviour, use `link_text_no_enhance` on the link in question, as shown. This will remove the visually hidden text, allowing you to add your own. The component will render a `span` element with a class of `govuk-visually-hidden` included in a passed [capture block](https://apidock.com/rails/ActionView/Helpers/CaptureHelper/capture) as the `link_text` parameter.
