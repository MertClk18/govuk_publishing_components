name: Feedback
description: Invites user feedback on the current page.
body: |
  This component is designed to sit at the bottom of pages on GOV.UK to allow users to submit feedback on that page.

  This component uses JavaScript for expanding and collapsing and also for submitting form responses. This code is not compatible with Internet Explorer, so IE11 and down do not use JavaScript to submit the forms, instead falling back to a normal form submission.
accessibility_criteria: |
  The form must:

  * be functional and accessible with JavaScript disabled
  * be usable and accessible with stylesheets disabled

  Form elements in the component must:

  * accept focus
  * be focusable with a keyboard
  * be usable with a keyboard
  * be usable with touch
  * indicate when they have focus
  * be recognisable as form input elements

  * be of the appropriate type for their use, e.g. password inputs should be of type `password`
