      For translations or other purposes, the text presented to the user in this component can be changed.

      Note that the error text prefix and announcements are hidden visually and used by assistive tools when there is an error.

      By default, the error prefix is "Error".

      By default, the password shown announcement is "Your password is visible".

      By default, the password hidden announcement is "Your password is hidden".
    data:
      label_text: Secret number
      error_text_prefix: Incompatible
      error_text: 6 is scared of 7, so they can't be next to each other.
