      The example shown applies a tracking attribute specifically for use by Google Tag Manager in [Content Publisher](https://github.com/alphagov/content-publisher).
      
      Other data attributes can also be applied as required. Note that the component does not include built in tracking. If this is required consider using the [track click script](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_publishing_components/blob/main/docs/analytics/track-click.md).
